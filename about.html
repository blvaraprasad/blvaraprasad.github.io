  <h1>About Me (or whatever this is)</h1>

  <section>
    <p>Hi. I'm Prasad. And if you’re reading this, it probably means you’re a person who clicked a link hoping for a professional backstory and got caught in a vortex of slightly existential self-awareness. Welcome.</p>

    <p>I’m a water resources engineer by trade, a system builder by compulsion, and a chronic overthinker by destiny. Somewhere between code and coffee, I decided life needed an operating system. So I made one. It’s this. It’s me. Hi.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "You are not your job. You are not your social media bio. You are the space between a calendar notification and a decision you haven’t made yet."
    </blockquote>

    <p>PrasadOS isn’t a company. It’s not a startup. It’s an interface for living deliberately. And sometimes irrationally. It runs on curiosity, mild caffeine addiction, and the firm belief that a clean spreadsheet can fix a broken week.</p>

    <p>I use AI, but I don’t worship it. I automate tasks, but not relationships. I like philosophy, but not philosophers. And I believe most career advice is just survivorship bias with better formatting.</p>

    <p>If you’re here for credentials: yes, I can code. Yes, I build models. Yes, I’ve been paid to solve problems with math. But more importantly, I once made a financial dashboard that sorted grocery transactions by emotional damage. That should count for something.</p>

    <p>This site is my test bench, my resume, my creative lab, and occasionally my rant platform. Proceed accordingly.</p>
